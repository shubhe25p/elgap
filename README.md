Getting Started with EBPF locally (tested on MacOS Intel)

     - Github Codespace (Azure linux) doesn't work
     - Can work with Cloud Platforms but requires multiple cores
       
2. Ubuntu 22.04 ISO (https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/)
     - Azure linux doesn't work, got some strange linux header files error.
     - Ubuntu 23/24 also didn't work for some unkown reason.
